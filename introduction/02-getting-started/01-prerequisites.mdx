## System Requirements

The AskUI SDK supports the following operating systems:

- **Windows**: Windows 10 or later
- **MacOS**: Version 10.15 or later
- **Linux**: Ubuntu 18.04 or later

## AskUI Account and IDE

You need an AskUI account to use the SDK. If you don't have one yet, sign up at 
 <Card>
    title="Create an AskUI Account"
    icon="user"
    href="app.askui.com"
  
  </Card>

You also need a workspace and an access token. You can create this by logging in [AskUI Studio](https://app.askui.com) and selecting a workspace (or create a new one) and then **Access Tokens** -> **Create Token**. Save this for later.

Furthermore, the best experience using AskUI is together with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). We recommend one of the following:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/)
- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)

## Installer

You need to download the latest [installer](02-api-reference/02-agent-os/04-installer) for your operating system. This will install following components:

- Vision Agent OS
- Vision Agent Controller
- Vision Agent Runner

You can find all download links [here](02-api-reference/02-agent-os/04-installer).
