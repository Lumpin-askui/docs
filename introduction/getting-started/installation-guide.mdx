For running AskUI on your machine, follow these steps. If you are running in an enterprise network, you might also want to check out [Proxy & TLS Configuration](/introduction/agent-setup/proxy-configuration).
<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Prerequisites">
    Make sure that you have:
    - Created an [AskUI account](https://app.askui.com)
    - Have an IDE installed
    - Have AskUI [installed](/introduction/agent-setup/installer)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate the AskUI Development Environment (ADE)">

  Open a terminal and run the following command:
   ```
   askui-shell
   ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your AskUI Account">
  Run the following command within the AskUI Shell to authenticate and connect your ADE to your AskUI account. Replace ```<access token>``` and ```<workspace id>``` with your real credentials from AskUI Studio.  
  ```
  AskUI-SetSettings -WorkspaceId <workspace id> -Token <access token>
  ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a New Project">
  Switch to a directory where you want to create the new AskUI project and run:
  ```
  AskUI-NewProject
  ```
  Then, follow the instructions in the terminal. This will install a new project and install all dependencies. This should look like this:
  ![Installation](/introduction/images/project-installation.png)

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the Controller">
  Make sure the controller is running. You can start it by running following command in the ADE:
  ```
  AskUI-startController
  ```
  The controller executes your automations on the screen it has selected. The white frame around your display showcases which screen this is.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the Project">
   You can now run your first project by running:
  ```
  AskUI-runProject
  ```
  This should look like this:
  ![Execution](/introduction/images/first-run.png)

    You can now start writing your first steps, which can be found in ```/YourProject/askui_example/my-first-askui-test-suite.test.ts```.

  </Step>

</Steps>

If there is an issue with the installation, it is most likely due to network issues, please refer to following page for this [Proxy & TLS Configuration](/introduction/agent-setup/proxy-configuration).
You can also ask the [Community](https://community.askui.com) for help.
