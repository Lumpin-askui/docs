## **Overview**

**AskUI Vision Agent** is a powerful AI-driven Python library designed to automate computer tasks with vision agents. Using Anthropic's Claude model, AskUI Vision Agent provides a straightforward way to automate operations across web browsers and applications on various operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

### **Key Features**

* Automate desktop and web tasks

* Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, MacOS, Linux)

* Multi-monitor support

* Real-time logging and debugging capabilities

* Advanced AI-driven task handling using Anthropic's Claude

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Prerequisites**

* **Python 3.6+** installed on your system.

* **AskUI Agent OS** for your operating system (Windows, Linux, MacOS) to control tasks across applications.

### **2. Installation Steps**

### **Step 1: Install AskUI Agent OS**

* Download and install AskUI Agent OS for your specific operating system:

  * \[Windows Installation Guide]

  * \[Linux Installation Guide]

  * \[MacOS Installation Guide]

### **Step 2: Install Vision Agent in Python**

* Use pip to install the AskUI Vision Agent in your Python environment:
  pip install askui



### **Step 3: Authenticate with Anthropic**

* Set up an **ANTHROPIC\_API\_KEY** environment variable to access Anthropic’s Claude model:

  * **Create an Anthropic key** [here](https://www.anthropic.com/) if you don’t have one.

* Configure the environment variable:

  * **Linux & MacOS**:
    export ANTHROPIC\_API\_KEY="your\_api\_key"



  * **Windows PowerShell**:
    $Env:ANTHROPIC\_API\_KEY = "your\_api\_key"



## **Using AskUI Vision Agent**

### **Basic Usage**

1. **Initialize the Agent** Import the `VisionAgent` class and initialize the agent as a context manager to start automating tasks.
   from askui import VisionAgent

   \# Initialize your agent
   with VisionAgent() as agent:
   &#x20;   \# Start browsing
   &#x20;   agent.tools.webbrowser.open\_new("\<http://www.google.com>")

   &#x20;   \# Automate individual steps
   &#x20;   agent.click("url bar")
   &#x20;   agent.type("\<http://www.google.com>")
   &#x20;   agent.keyboard("enter")

   &#x20;   \# Extract information
   &#x20;   datetime = agent.get("What is the datetime at the top of the screen?")
   &#x20;   print(datetime)

   &#x20;   \# Example autonomous task
   &#x20;   agent.act("search for a flight from Berlin to Paris in January")



### **Advanced Features**

### **1. Logging for Debugging**

Gain insights into the agent’s actions by setting the log level to `DEBUG`.

import logging
with VisionAgent(log\_level=logging.DEBUG) as agent:
&#x20;   agent...



### **2. Multi-Monitor Support**

Select which monitor the agent will interact with by specifying the `display` parameter. Set it to `1` for the primary monitor, `2` for the secondary, etc.

with VisionAgent(display=1) as agent:
&#x20;   agent...
