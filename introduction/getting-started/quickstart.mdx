title: Quickstart Tutorial
description: 'Write your first automations with AskUI.'
---

In this quickstart tutorial, we will guide you through your first automation on a [web calculator](https://askui.github.io/askui-practice-page/). We will calculate **7 + 7** and then extract the calculation result in a variable.
Please make your you followed through the [Installation Guide](/introduction/getting-started/installation-guide) prior to this.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Project">
    
  (Skip this if you have already done this)

  Switch to a directory where you want to create the new AskUI project and run:
    ```
     AskUI-NewProject
    ```
  Then, follow the instructions in the terminal. We will call it ```test```. Select ```y``` when asked if you want to save the Directory in the current path.
  This should look like this:
  ![Installation](/introduction/images/project-installation.png)
  </Step>


  <Step title="Open Your Project">
    Open your project and navigate to ```/yourProject/askui_example/my-first-askui-test-suite.test.ts```
    You will see some example code there.
    
    Out of the box, we use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as an automation framework (you can choose any other one as well). The basic principle is like the following:

  ```
    // Import Statements: Begin by importing necessary AskUI modules and helpers.
    import { aui } from './helpers/askui-helper';

    // describe Block: Groups related UI automation scenarios or tests.
    describe('AskUI Automation Scenarios', () => {

      // it Blocks: Each block defines a specific UI interaction 
      // or automation task, such as form submissions, navigation,
      // or simulating user actions.
      it('executes a specific task', async () => {

        // AskUI Instructions: Commands provided for running the automated
        // tasks or tests through the terminal.
        await aui.click().text("Button Name").exec();

        // Additional automation logic
      });

      // More it blocks for different scenarios
    });
  ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Opening an application and navigating to an URL">
  
  First, we need to open the browser as an application and navigate to the calucator website, we want to automate. For that we use following code dependant on your OS:
  ```
    // Open Google Chrome on Windows
    await aui.execOnShell("start chrome").exec();
  ```
  ```
    // Open Google Chrome on macOS
    await aui.execOnShell("open -a 'Google Chrome'").exec();
  ```
  ```
    // Open Google Chrome on Linux
    await aui.execOnShell("chrome").exec();
  ```

  You can also start any other application on your OS like that. After that we need to navigate to the web application. We do so by adding following code:

  ```
  await aui.type(https://askui.github.io/askui-practice-page/).exec();
  await aui.pressKey('enter').exec();
  ```
  This will simply type the URL on your keyboard and hit the enter button. If your url bar is not in focus, you can add a ```await aui.mouseLeftClick().exec();```.
 
  </Step>
  <Step title="(Optional) See What the Vision Agents Sees">
  
  As a next step, we can enter an annotation command to see what the Vision Agent sees during execution. This can be very handy for debugging.
  For that, we add following command to our automation script:

  ```
  await aui.annotate();
  ```

  We can then execute the automation by opening the ```askui-shell``` and running (do not forget to start the controller first):

  ```
  askui-runProject
  ```
  While execution, your display frame should turn purple which indicates the Agent Controller executing the steps. After successfully running, the ```annotate()```will ahve created a new file in the folder ```/test/report/your_annotation```.
  We can open that file in the browser and can see what the Vision Agent sees:

  <img src="/introduction/images/annotation.png" alt="annotation" />

  You can also hover over the elements to see their class.

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Interacting With Elements">
   As a next step, we want to interact with these elements. For selecting elements, you have following options:

    - **Text Selectors**: Use visible text for finding elements
    - **AI Elements**: Train custom elements into your AI model
    - **UI Element Classes**: Use pre-trained elements
    - **Ask Command**: This command uses GenAI for visual extraction or answering questions to the current screen

  A complete overview can be found in the [Prompt-to-Action APIs](/api-reference/api-reference/prompt-to-action).
  
  For this tutorial, we will be using the **AI Element** and the **Ask Command**. As we can see on the annotation, not all elements are detected out-of-the-box.
  For example, lets calculate **7 + 7** and extract the result from the page. If **7** would be detected as text, we could use the **Text Selector** ```await aui.click().text().withText("7").exec();```.
  However, as this is not the case, we will make use of the **AI Element**.

  You can import this function by typing in the terminal (ADE):

  ```
  AskUI-ImportExperimentalCommands
  ```

  and then:
  ```
  AskUI-newAIElement
  ```

  This opens a snipping tool, which you can use to crop out elements for storing them. We will now crop out the **button with number 7**, the **button +** and the **button with the equals sign**. Then press **esc** and you can name them, like here:
  ![AI Element](/introduction/images/ai-element.gif)

  We can now use those elements in our automation with ```await aui.click().aiElement('name').exec();```, the whole script then looks like this:

  ```
  await aui.execOnShell("open -a 'Google Chrome'").exec();

  await aui.type(https://askui.github.io/askui-practice-page/).exec();
  await aui.pressKey('enter').exec();

  await aui.click().aiElement('button_7').exec();
  await aui.click().aiElement('button_plus').exec();
  await aui.click().aiElement('button_7').exec();
  await aui.click().aiElement('button_equals').exec();

  const s =  await aui.ask("What is the calculation result?");
  console.log(s);

  ```
  You can see that we also make use of the **Ask Command** which retrieves a value which we then print to the console (we could also use this in an assertion). In this case, the result of the calculation.

  If we run the whole code, we get - which is the correct value:

  ![Ask Command](/introduction/images/ask-command.png)

  This combination of navigating through UIs and extracting values can be very powerful as you can see.
